# BLOGGY

A simple social blogging site I am working on. Focusing more on the backend written in Python.

During development, I faced server reload issues pertaining to the static files (CSS specifically), so as a quick substitute I resolved to writing the little CSS I needed inside the HTML files. The work may be a bit messy but it works for now and changes will be made once I'm satisfied with site funcitonality.

Once code is downloaded or repository is cloned, remember to create a virtual environment. Pip install all required packages included in the requirements text file. More unneccessary python packages are listed there due to a slight mishap while creating the virtual environment using PyCharm.
